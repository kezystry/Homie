"""The deploy-side HomeClient seam — the binding from Act to the physical home.

`core/act.py` defines the `HomeClient` Protocol (`drive` + `on_state_change`); the
real implementation is an MQTT / Home Assistant client. That adapter is a later
deploy milestone — until it lands, `home_from_env()` returns a `LoggingHome` so the
WHOLE daemon graph (Act, the StateReconciler, the friction loop) runs end-to-end on
a box with no HA wired yet. This is deliberate: the keystone invariant is that
production runs the one assembled graph, differing from tests only by what
`HomeClient` is injected — so even the no-HA box must inject *a* home, never skip Act.
